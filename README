                       fps : Fast Packed Strings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the FastPackedString library from darcs as a
cabalised package.

Requirements:
        > Cabal

Building:
        > ln -s fps.cabal.mmap fps.cabal
        > runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/f/g
        > runhaskell build
        > runhaskell install

If you have troubles with mmap (possibly you have a system without
mmap), then try:

        > ln -s fps.cabal.no-mmap fps.cabal

as your first step.

After installation, you can run the testsuite:

        > cd tests ; make ; make run

Authors:
    FastPackedString is derived from the GHC PackedString library, 
    originallly written by Bryan O'Sullivan, and then by Simon Marlow.
    It was adapted, and greatly extended for darcs by David Roundy, and
    others. Don Stewart cleaned up and extended the implementation.
