* do we need elems?
* state more clearly the null-termination property of strict ByteStrings
* would it make sense to move the IO bits into a different module too?
        - System.IO.ByteString
        - Data.ByteString.IO
* packByte / singleton 
* pack/unpack -> fromList/toList ?
* breakFirst, breakLast gone?
* sanitise uses of the *End suffix.
* can we avoid joinWithByte?
* unfoldr is needed.
