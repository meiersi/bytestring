                       fps : Fast Packed Strings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the FastPackedString library from darcs as a
cabalised package.

Requirements:
        > Cabal

Building:
        > ln -s fps.cabal.mmap fps.cabal
        > runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/f/g
        > runhaskell Setup.hs build
        > runhaskell Setup.hs install

If you have troubles with mmap (possibly you have a system without
mmap), then try:

        > ln -s fps.cabal.no-mmap fps.cabal

as your first step.

After installation, you can run the testsuite:

        > cd tests ; make ; make run

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors:
    FastPackedString is derived from the GHC PackedString library, 
    originallly written by Bryan O'Sullivan, and then by Simon Marlow.
    It was adapted, and greatly extended for darcs by David Roundy, and
    others. Don Stewart cleaned up and extended the implementation.

Performance:

This table compares the performance of common operations in both
PackedString and FastPackedString, on 1M of data:

function:   FastPackedString        PackedString
pack        21M, 0.08 secs          24M, 0.08 secs

unpack . pack
            40M, 0.14 secs          80M, 0.26 secs
