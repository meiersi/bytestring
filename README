                       fps : Fast Packed Strings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the FastPackedString library from darcs as a cabalised package.

Requirements:
        > The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
        > Cabal

Building:
        > ln -s fps.cabal.mmap fps.cabal
        > runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/f/g
        > runhaskell build
        > runhaskell install

If you have troubles with mmap (possibly you have a system without mmap), then try:
        > ln -s fps.cabal.no-mmap fps.cabal
as your first step.

After installation, you can run the testsuite:
        > cd tests ; make ; ./run-utests

Authors:
    FastPackedString is derived from the GHC PackedString library, 
    originallly written by Bryan O'Sullivan, and then by Simon Marlow.
    It was adapted, and greatly extended for darcs by David Roundy, and
    others. Don Stewart cleaned up some of the code, made some small
    fixes, and cabalised it.
