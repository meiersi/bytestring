----------

* state more clearly the null-termination property of strict ByteStrings
* would it make sense to move the IO bits into a different module too?
        - System.IO.ByteString
        - Data.ByteString.IO
* packByte / singleton 
* pack/unpack -> fromList/toList ?
* breakFirst, breakLast gone?
* sanitise uses of the *End suffix.
* can we avoid joinWithByte?
* unfoldr is needed.

* think about Data.ByteString.hGetLines. is it needed in the presence of
* cheap lines =<< Data.ByteString.Lazy.getContents?
* unchunk, Data.ByteString.Lazy -> [Data.ByteString]
    -  and that'd work for any Lazy.ByteString, not just hGetContents >>= lines
