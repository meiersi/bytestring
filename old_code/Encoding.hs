-- An /encoding/ is a conversion function of Haskell values to sequences of
-- bytes. A /bounded encoding/ is an encoding that never results in a sequence
-- longer than some fixed number of bytes. This number of bytes must be
-- independent of the value being encoded. Typical examples of bounded
-- encodings are the big-endian encoding of a 'Word64', which results always
-- in exactly 8 bytes, or the UTF-8 encoding of a 'Char', which results always
-- in less or equal to 4 bytes.
--
-- Typically, encodings are implemented efficiently by allocating a buffer (an
-- array of bytes) and repeatedly executing the following two steps: (1)
-- writing to the buffer until it is full and (2) handing over the filled part
-- to the consumer of the encoded value. Step (1) is where bounded encodings
-- are used. We must use a bounded encoding, as we must check that there is
-- enough free space /before/ actually writing to the buffer.
--
-- In term of expressivity, it would be sufficient to construct all encodings
-- from the single bounded encoding that encodes a 'Word8' as-is. However,
-- this is not sufficient in terms of efficiency. It results in unnecessary
-- buffer-full checks and it complicates the program-flow for writing to the
-- buffer, as buffer-full checks are interleaved with analyzing the value to be
-- encoded (e.g., think about the program-flow for UTF-8 encoding). This has a
-- significant effect on overall encoding performance, as encoding primitive
-- Haskell values such as 'Word8's or 'Char's lies at the heart of every
-- encoding implementation.
--
-- The bounded 'Encoding's provided by this module remove this performance
-- problem. Intuitively, they consist of a tuple of the bound on the maximal
-- number of bytes written and the actual implementation of the encoding as a
-- function that modifies a mutable buffer. Hence when executing a bounded
-- 'Encoding', the buffer-full check can be done once before the actual writing
-- to the buffer. The provided 'Encoding's also take care to implement the
-- actual writing to the buffer efficiently. Moreover, combinators are
-- provided to construct new bounded encodings from the provided ones. 
--
-- A typical example for using the combinators is a bounded 'Encoding' that
-- combines escaping the ' and \\ characters with UTF-8 encoding. More
-- precisely, the escaping to be done is the one implemented by the following
-- @escape@ function.
--
-- > escape :: Char -> [Char]
-- > escape '\'' = "\\'"
-- > escape '\\' = "\\\\"
-- > escape c    = [c]
--
-- The bounded 'Encoding' that combines this escaping with UTF-8 encoding is
-- the following.
--
-- > import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder.BoundedEncoding.Utf8 (char)
-- >
-- > {-# INLINE escapeChar #-}
-- > escapeUtf8 :: Encoding Char
-- > escapeUtf8 = 
-- >     encodeIf ('\'' ==) (char <#> char #. const ('\\','\'')) $
-- >     encodeIf ('\\' ==) (char <#> char #. const ('\\','\\')) $
-- >     char
--
-- The definition of 'escapeUtf8' is more complicated than 'escape', because
-- the combinators ('encodeIf', 'encodePair', '#.', and 'char') used in
-- 'escapeChar' compute both the bound on the maximal number of bytes written
-- (8 for 'escapeUtf8') as well as the low-level buffer manipulation required
-- to implement the encoding. Bounded 'Encoding's should always be inlined.
-- Otherwise, the compiler cannot compute the bound on the maximal number of
-- bytes written at compile-time. Without inlinining, it would also fail to
-- optimize the constant encoding of the escape characters in the above
-- example. Functions that execute bounded 'Encoding's also perform
-- suboptimally, if the definition of the bounded 'Encoding' is not inlined.
-- Therefore we add an 'INLINE' pragma to 'escapeUtf8'.
--
-- Currently, the only library that executes bounded 'Encoding's is the
-- 'bytestring' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring>). It
-- uses bounded 'Encoding's to implement most of its lazy bytestring builders.
-- Executing a bounded encoding should be done using the corresponding
-- functions in the lazy bytestring builder 'Extras' module.
