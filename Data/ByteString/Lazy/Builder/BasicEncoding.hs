An /encoding/ is a conversion function of Haskell values to sequences of bytes. 
A /fixed(-size) encoding/ is an encoding that always results in sequence of bytes
  of a pre-determined, fixed length.
An example for a fixed encoding is the big-endian encoding of a 'Word64', 
  which always results in exactly 8 bytes. 
A /bounded(-size) encoding/ is an encoding that always results in sequence
  of bytes that is no larger than a pre-determined bound.
An example for a bounded encoding is the UTF-8 encoding of a 'Char', 
  which results always in less or equal to 4 bytes.
Note that every fixed encoding is also a bounded encoding.
We explicitly identify fixed encodings because they allow some optimizations
  that are impossible with bounded encodings.
In the following,
  we first motivate the use of bounded encodings
  and then give examples of optimizations 
  that are only possible with fixed encodings.

Typicall, encodings are implemented efficiently by allocating a buffer 
  (a mutable array of bytes) 
  and repeatedly executing the following two steps: 
  (1) writing to the buffer until it is full and 
  (2) handing over the filled part to the consumer of the encoded value. 
Step (1) is where bounded encodings are used. 
We must use a bounded encoding, 
  as we must check that there is enough free space 
  /before/ actually writing to the buffer.

In term of expressivity, 
  it would be sufficient to construct all encodings
  from the single fixed encoding that encodes a 'Word8' as-is. 
However,
  this is not sufficient in terms of efficiency. 
It results in unnecessary buffer-full checks and 
  it complicates the program-flow for writing to the buffer, 
  as buffer-full checks are interleaved with analyzing the value to be
  encoded (e.g., think about the program-flow for UTF-8 encoding). 
This has a significant effect on overall encoding performance, 
  as encoding primitive Haskell values such as 'Word8's or 'Char's 
  lies at the heart of every encoding implementation.

The 'BoundedEncoding's provided by this module remove this performance problem. 
Intuitively, 
  they consist of a tuple of the bound on the maximal number of bytes written 
  and the actual implementation of the encoding as 
  a function that modifies a mutable buffer. 
Hence when executing a 'BoundedEncoding', 
 the buffer-full check can be done once before the actual writing to the buffer. 
The provided 'BoundedEncoding's also take care to implement the
  actual writing to the buffer efficiently. 
Moreover, combinators are provided to construct new bounded encodings 
  from the provided ones. 



The result of an encoding can be consumed efficiently,
  if it is represented as a sequence of large enough 
  /chunks/ of consecutive memory (i.e., C @char@ arrays).
The precise meaning of /large enough/ is application dependent.
Typically, an average chunk size between 4kb and 32kb is suitable
  for writing the result to disk or sending it over the network.
We desire large enough chunk sizes because each chunk boundary
  incurs extra work that we must be able to amortize.


The need for fixed-size encodings arises when considering
  the efficient implementation of encodings that require the encoding of a
  value to be prefixed with the size of the resulting sequence of bytes.
An efficient implementation avoids unnecessary buffer
We can implement this efficiently as follows.
We first reserve the space for the encoding of the size.
Then, we encode the value.
Finally, we encode the size of the resulting sequence of bytes into
  the reserved space.
For this to work

This works only if the encoding resulting size fits 

by first, reserving the space for the encoding
  of the size, then performing the 
  
For efficiency,
  we want to avoid unnecessary copying.


For example, the HTTP/1.0 requires the size of the body to be given in
  the Content-Length field.

chunked-transfer encoding requires each chunk to
  be prefixed with the hexadecimal encoding of the chunk size.

-- A /bounded encoding/ is an encoding that never results in a sequence
-- longer than some fixed number of bytes. This number of bytes must be
-- independent of the value being encoded. Typical examples of bounded
-- encodings are the big-endian encoding of a 'Word64', which results always
-- in exactly 8 bytes, or the UTF-8 encoding of a 'Char', which results always
-- in less or equal to 4 bytes.
--
-- Typically, encodings are implemented efficiently by allocating a buffer (an
-- array of bytes) and repeatedly executing the following two steps: (1)
-- writing to the buffer until it is full and (2) handing over the filled part

-- 'Encoding', the buffer-full check can be done once before the actual writing
-- to the buffer. The provided 'Encoding's also take care to implement the
-- actual writing to the buffer efficiently. Moreover, combinators are
-- provided to construct new bounded encodings from the provided ones. 
--
-- A typical example for using the combinators is a bounded 'Encoding' that
-- combines escaping the ' and \\ characters with UTF-8 encoding. More
-- precisely, the escaping to be done is the one implemented by the following
-- @escape@ function.
--
-- > escape :: Char -> [Char]
-- > escape '\'' = "\\'"
-- > escape '\\' = "\\\\"
-- > escape c    = [c]
--
-- The bounded 'Encoding' that combines this escaping with UTF-8 encoding is
-- the following.
--
-- > import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder.BasicEncoding.Utf8 (char)
-- >
-- > {-# INLINE escapeChar #-}
-- > escapeUtf8 :: BoundedEncoding Char
-- > escapeUtf8 = 
-- >     encodeIf ('\'' ==) (char <#> char #. const ('\\','\'')) $
-- >     encodeIf ('\\' ==) (char <#> char #. const ('\\','\\')) $
-- >     char
--
-- The definition of 'escapeUtf8' is more complicated than 'escape', because
-- the combinators ('encodeIf', 'encodePair', '#.', and 'char') used in
-- 'escapeChar' compute both the bound on the maximal number of bytes written
-- (8 for 'escapeUtf8') as well as the low-level buffer manipulation required
-- to implement the encoding. Bounded 'Encoding's should always be inlined.
-- Otherwise, the compiler cannot compute the bound on the maximal number of
-- bytes written at compile-time. Without inlinining, it would also fail to
-- optimize the constant encoding of the escape characters in the above
-- example. Functions that execute bounded 'Encoding's also perform
-- suboptimally, if the definition of the bounded 'Encoding' is not inlined.
-- Therefore we add an 'INLINE' pragma to 'escapeUtf8'.
--
-- Currently, the only library that executes bounded 'Encoding's is the
-- 'bytestring' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring>). It
-- uses bounded 'Encoding's to implement most of its lazy bytestring builders.
-- Executing a bounded encoding should be done using the corresponding
-- functions in the lazy bytestring builder 'Extras' module.
--
-- TODO: Merge with explanation/example below
--
-- Bounded 'E.Encoding's abstract encodings of Haskell values that can be implemented by
-- writing a bounded-size sequence of bytes directly to memory. They are
-- lifted to conversions from Haskell values to 'Builder's by wrapping them
-- with a bound-check. The compiler can implement this bound-check very
-- efficiently (i.e, a single comparison of the difference of two pointers to a
-- constant), because the bound of a 'E.Encoding' is always independent of the
-- value being encoded and, in most cases, a literal constant.
--
-- 'E.Encoding's are the primary means for defining conversion functions from
-- primitive Haskell values to 'Builder's. Most 'Builder' constructors
-- provided by this library are implemented that way. 
-- 'E.Encoding's are also used to construct conversions that exploit the internal
-- representation of data-structures. 
--
-- For example, 'encodeByteStringWith' works directly on the underlying byte
-- array and uses some tricks to reduce the number of variables in its inner
-- loop. Its efficiency is exploited for implementing the @filter@ and @map@
-- functions in "Data.ByteString.Lazy" as
--
-- > import qualified Codec.Bounded.Encoding as E
-- >
-- > filter :: (Word8 -> Bool) -> ByteString -> ByteString
-- > filter p = toLazyByteString . encodeLazyByteStringWithB write
-- >   where
-- >     write = E.encodeIf p E.word8 E.emptyEncoding
-- >
-- > map :: (Word8 -> Word8) -> ByteString -> ByteString
-- > map f = toLazyByteString . encodeLazyByteStringWithB (E.word8 E.#. f)
--
-- Compared to earlier versions of @filter@ and @map@ on lazy 'L.ByteString's,
-- these versions use a more efficient inner loop and have the additional
-- advantage that they always result in well-chunked 'L.ByteString's; i.e, they
-- also perform automatic defragmentation.
--
-- We can also use 'E.Encoding's to improve the efficiency of the following
-- 'renderString' function from our UTF-8 CSV table encoding example in
-- "Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder".
-- 
-- > renderString :: String -> Builder
-- > renderString cs = charUtf8 '"' <> foldMap escape cs <> charUtf8 '"'
-- >   where
-- >     escape '\\' = charUtf8 '\\' <> charUtf8 '\\'
-- >     escape '\"' = charUtf8 '\\' <> charUtf8 '\"'
-- >     escape c    = charUtf8 c
--
-- The idea is to save on 'mappend's by implementing a 'E.Encoding' that escapes
-- characters and using 'encodeListWith', which implements writing a list of
-- values with a tighter inner loop and no 'mappend'.
--
-- > import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder.Extras     -- assume these three
-- > import Codec.Bounded.Encoding                  -- imports are present
-- >        ( BoundedEncoding, encodeIf, (<#>), (#.) )
-- > import Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder.BasicEncoding.Utf8 (char)  
-- > 
-- > renderString :: String -> Builder
-- > renderString cs = 
-- >     charUtf8 '"' <> encodeListWithB escapedUtf8 cs <> charUtf8 '"'
-- >   where
-- >     escapedUtf8 :: BoundedEncoding Char
-- >     escapedUtf8 = 
-- >       encodeIf (== '\\') (char <#> char #. const ('\\', '\\')) $
-- >       encodeIf (== '\"') (char <#> char #. const ('\\', '\"')) $
-- >       char
--
-- This 'Builder' considers a buffer with less than 8 free bytes as full. As
-- all functions are inlined, the compiler is able to optimize the constant
-- 'E.Encoding's as two sequential 'poke's. Compared to the first implementation of
-- 'renderString' this implementation is 1.7x faster.

{-
Internally, 'Builder's are buffer-fill operations that are
given a continuation buffer-fill operation and a buffer-range to be filled.
A 'Builder' first checks if the buffer-range is large enough. If that's
the case, the 'Builder' writes the sequences of bytes to the buffer and
calls its continuation.  Otherwise, it returns a signal that it requires a
new buffer together with a continuation to be called on this new buffer.
Ignoring the rare case of a full buffer-range, the execution cost of a
'Builder' consists of three parts: 

  1. The time taken to read the parameters; i.e., the buffer-fill
     operation to call after the 'Builder' is done and the buffer-range to
     fill. 

  2. The time taken to check for the size of the buffer-range.

  3. The time taken for the actual encoding.

We can reduce cost (1) by ensuring that fewer buffer-fill function calls are
required. We can reduce cost (2) by fusing buffer-size checks of sequential
writes. For example, when escaping a 'String' using 'renderString', it would
be sufficient to check before encoding a character that at least 8 bytes are
free. We can reduce cost (3) by implementing better primitive 'Builder's.
For example, 'renderCell' builds an intermediate list containing the decimal
representation of an 'Int'. Implementing a direct decimal encoding of 'Int's
to memory would be more efficient, as it requires fewer buffer-size checks
and less allocation. It is also a planned extension of this library.

The first two cost reductions are supported for user code through functions
in "Data.ByteString.Lazy.Builder.Extras". There, we continue the above example
and drop the generation time to 0.8ms by implementing 'renderString' more
cleverly. The third reduction requires meddling with the internals of
'Builder's and is not recomended in code outside of this library. However,
patches to this library are very welcome.

-- If the output does not fit into the current free buffer size,
